# Installations
The only installation required is to have Python installed. There are no libraries that are used which are not built-in. You can download python at: https://www.python.org/

# Capstone 1 - Finance Calculator
This program provides an interface which takes values pertinent to either an investment or a bond loan and calculates an amount based on interest rate and a number of months. It can calculate both simple and compund interest.
# How to use
Once the program is running it will give you the below options:

The input requires precision to work. It then takes all the relevant data and allows you to choose compound or simple interest if you chose investment:

The program then completes the calculations and prints the answer, before returning to the beginning and allowing the user to make another calculation.

# Capstone 2 - Task Manager
This project is a task manager with multiple features. It has an admin login which is able to register other users, view and edit tasks for themselves and others, add tasks, view statistics, and generate reports

# How to use
Upon running the program it requests user login. If you do not have user registered on the program then login with **username**: *admin* and **password**: *password*. You can then create a new user, add new tasks and access the other features of the program.

## User Menu:
Below you can see the options given to the user once they have logged in.

## Viewing Tasks
Here is the view of all the tasks. The program will allow the admin to check tasks for all users, whilst other users can only check their own tasks.

## Generating Statistics
The program allows admins to view the statistics associated with users and tasks, as well as generating a report in an external text file.

The program will store the relevant information (users, tasks, etc) on text documents in the same directory as the program.



Happy organising.
