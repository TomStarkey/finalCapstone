# Installation
The only installation required is to have Python installed. There are no libraries that are used which are not built-in. You can download python at: https://www.python.org/

# How to use
Upon running the program it requests user login. If you do not have user registered on the program then login with **username**: *admin* and **password**: *password*. You can then create a new user, add new tasks and access the other features of the program.

## User Menu:
Below you can see the options given to the user once they have logged in.

## Viewing Tasks
Here is the view of all the tasks. The program will allow the admin to check tasks for all users, whilst other users can only check their own tasks.

The program will store the relevant information (users, tasks, etc) on text documents in the same directory as the program.



Happy organising.
